# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering is a discipline that deals with systematic development, operation  and maintenance of software systems and it differs from traditional programming because it is more comprehensive and structured approach to creating software  whereas traditional programming is more focused on writing code.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
-Requirements: collecting, gathering and documenting user and system requirement 
-Design: creating a detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
-Implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design specification
-Testing : conducting various tests  to ensure the software meets functional requirements
-Deployment: releasing the software to users or customers 
-Maintenance :  updating , fixing and  enhancing  the software  after its release 


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Waterfall Model:
Sequential and Linear: Waterfall follows a step-by-step approach with distinct phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) completed in order.
Thorough Planning: Detailed planning occurs upfront, and each stage depends on the completion of the previous one.
Rigid and Predictable: Changes are challenging once a phase is complete.
Preferred Scenarios:
Well-defined requirements.
Stable project scope.
Critical systems (e.g., aerospace, medical) where predictability is crucial.

Agile Model:
Iterative and Flexible: Agile emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation.
Sprints and Iterations: Work is divided into short time-based bursts (Sprints), allowing frequent value delivery.
Self-Organizing Teams: Agile teams decide how to allocate resources and adapt to changing priorities.
Preferred Scenarios:
Dynamic requirements.
Rapidly evolving markets.
Collaborative environments.
Web and mobile applications.
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
It is a process used in software engineering that defines and maintains the requirements 
of a software system. Software requirements engineering is important for gathering and 
documenting user and systems requirements

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

It relates to breaking down a complex software system into smaller, manageable 
components or modules. Modules are designed to work together to achieve the overall 
functionality

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Version Control Systems:

-Unit testing : Tests individual software components or units to ensure they function correctly 
-Intergration testing : combines multiple units to test how they work together 
-System testing : tests the entire software system to ensure it meets the requirements and works as expected 
-Acceptance system : verifies the software meets user acceptance criteria and is ready for release 
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Software tools for cracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team 
members there are different types of version control systems namely:
- Local control systems 
- Centralised version control systems 
- Distributed version control systems

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

the software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects
responsibilities of a software project management include :
-project planning 
-team management 
-documentation 
-monitoring and control 
-testing and deployment 
challenges faced in managing software projects:
-Delivering on time and on budget 
-creating and maintaining an agile culture 
-Budget constraints 

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software Maintenance: Software maintenance is an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). It begins after the software is deployed and aims to ensure that the software remains relevant and effective over time. Here are the key aspects:

Corrective Maintenance:
Purpose: Resolving issues or defects in the software.
Activities: Debugging, bug fixes, and patching.
Importance: Ensures the software functions correctly and addresses user-reported problems.
Adaptive Maintenance:
Purpose: Adapting the software to changing environments (e.g., new hardware, OS updates).
Activities: System updates, compatibility adjustments.
Importance: Keeps the software compatible with evolving technologies.
Perfective Maintenance:
Purpose: Enhancing software performance and features.
Activities: Optimization, adding new features, improving usability.
Importance: Enhances user experience and competitiveness.
Preventive Maintenance:
Purpose: Proactively preventing future issues.
Activities: Code refactoring, security enhancements.
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

-Algorithmic Bias: Software systems can perpetuate biases present in training data, leading to unfair outcomes. Engineers should actively address bias during development and testing.
-Personal Data Collection: Profiling users without their consent or collecting excessive personal data can raise privacy concerns. Engineers should prioritize user privacy and transparency.
-Weak Security Protection: Neglecting security measures can lead to data breaches or unauthorized access. Engineers must prioritize robust security practices.
-Feature-Impact Relationship: Just because a feature can be implemented doesnâ€™t mean it should. Engineers should consider the impact and potential harm before adding new feature

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
